# What is socketio 
Socket.IO is a JavaScript library for realtime web applications. It enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser,
and a server-side library for Node.js. Both components have a nearly identical API. Like Node.js, it is event-driven.
Socket.IO primarily uses the WebSocket protocol with polling as a fallback option,[3] while providing the same interface. 
Although it can be used as simply a wrapper for WebSocket, it provides many more features, including broadcasting to multiple sockets, storing data associated with each client, and asynchronous I/O.

It can be installed with the npm tool.[4][5]
